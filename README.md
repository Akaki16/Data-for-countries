# Country Search App

This project was created by the React library.

I used [REST COUNTRIES API](https://restcountries.com/) to create this project

Also I used [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/current) API to display country weather information.

Styling is done in Vanilla CSS.

## Featuring

* React - UI framework
* React Hook - a way to use state and side-effects in React function components
* axios - a http client

## App info

You can search almost any country in the world

You need to specify search query

If there are many countries matching with search query, Those country names are displayed and you can see their details by clicking the button.

If one country mathes with search query, only this country is displayed with its details.

Also country weather information is provided.
